Research Paper,arXiv,Intelligent Debris Mass Estimation Model for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10617v3,"Marine debris poses a significant threat to the survival of marine wildlife, often leading to entanglement and starvation, ultimately resulting in death. Therefore, removing debris from the ocean is crucial to restore the natural balance and allow marine life to thrive. Instance segmentation is an advanced form of object detection that identifies objects and precisely locates and separates them, m...",Published: 2023-09-19,12,True,True
Research Paper,arXiv,Detailed Evaluation of Modern Machine Learning Approaches for Optic Plastics Sorting,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16513v1,"According to the EPA, only 25% of waste is recycled, and just 60% of U.S. municipalities offer curbside recycling. Plastics fare worse, with a recycling rate of only 8%; an additional 16% is incinerated, while the remaining 76% ends up in landfills. The low plastic recycling rate stems from contamination, poor economic incentives, and technical difficulties, making efficient recycling a challenge....",Published: 2025-05-22,12,False,True

Research Paper,arXiv,Instance Semantic Segmentation Benefits from Generative Adversarial Networks,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13757v2,"In design of instance segmentation networks that reconstruct masks, segmentation is often taken as its literal definition -- assigning each pixel a label. This has led to thinking the problem as a template matching one with the goal of minimizing the loss between the reconstructed and the ground truth pixels. Rethinking reconstruction networks as a generator, we define the problem of predicting ma...",Published: 2020-10-26,9,True,True
